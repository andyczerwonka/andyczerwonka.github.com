    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm in Katowice, Poland on a business trip for a few days, so this weekend we decided to head out to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakopane">Zakopane</a>, the popular mountain town in southern Poland. First things first, let's go fill up the tank given we're in for a long day.</p>

<p>WTF? Gas is expensive, basically double of what we're used to in Calgary. No wonder people don't drive around here unless they have to. It's a significant part of your budget when you're thinking about vacation.</p>

<p>About an hour into our trip the weather was getting worse by the minute. By the time we arrived it was raining so hard we needed to pull over and figure out our next move given we didn't prepare for the rain.</p>

<p>We found a little shop that sold cheap rain jackets for a couple of złoty. Given the amount of people walking around, it's no atypical to get this much rain. Armed with protection from the elements we walked up and down Krupówki (the main <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulica_Krup%C3%B3wki_w_Zakopanem">deptak</a> in Zakopene) for a couple of hours. It was really interesting to see the different types of street food, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscypek">Oscypek</a>, and heavily smoked sheep's milk cheese that is grilled and typically served with a sweet berry compote.</p>

<p>All-in-all Krupówki was a fun place to hang out for the day. After lunch we decided to head out given we wanted to see a few more places before heading back to Katowice. On the way out of town we drove past <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanktuarium_Matki_Bo%C5%BCej_Fatimskiej_w_Zakopanem">Sanktuarium Matki Bożej Fatimskiej</a>, a sanctuary that was consecrated by Pope John Paul II in 1981. Given the amount of attention it was getting by other tourists, we decided to loop back and have a look.</p>

<p>After an hour of walking around these serene grounds, off to Slovakia!</p>

<p>I'm not sure why we decided to head this far south, but I guess why not? It's another country I can knock off my list. :-)</p>

<p>Our brief encounter with Slovakia through gave me a tiny glimpse of what seemed to be a much quieter life when compared to Poland. Not many people in the streets. People just doing their thing. What was slightly alarming was that even though the main highway (or should I say <em>side street</em>) ran right through the middle of their town, people were ignorant of the fact that cars were, in some cases, moving up to 80 km/hr. It didn't seem to phase anyone or anything. People continued to walk down the road with kids, dogs, chickens, cows, etc. Yes, we saw a lady walking her cow down the street. Awesome. I missed that shot.</p>

<p>I don't remember when we passed from Slovakia into the Czech Republic. Nothing seemed to change. The roadway's are lined with homes, stores, cemeteries, lakes, farms and even a golf course. This is beautiful country.</p>
