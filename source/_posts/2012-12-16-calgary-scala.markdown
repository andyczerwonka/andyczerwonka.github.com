I've moved [Calgary Scala](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/115918964995782373052) over to [Google+ Communities](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities). With the combination of Communities, Events and Hangouts, I think Google's offering has surpassed [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) as the best service to manage Calgary Scala.

I'll see you in 2013 at our first [Calgary Scala Community Event!](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cupsgrdu33lr5krnoqk4513df9o)
