I've been thinking about web application architecture for a while now. I've taken many client-side and server-side frameworks for a spin over the last six-to-nine months. I've built prototype after prototype. I've learned a lot. I *think* I've learned enough to be innovative yet commercially responsible. It's time to take the next step.

[Dolphin](https://github.com/andyczerwonka/dolphin) is a project that will bring together a bunch of technologies that I've been testing in for a large portion of 2012. 2013 will be the year where those efforts will finally produce a commercial offering. Dolphin will not only deliver new value as an integrated product in the the [3esi](http://www.3esi.com/) application suite, it'll uncover the delivery vehicle for the next generation of 3esi products.

I'm excited to get started.
