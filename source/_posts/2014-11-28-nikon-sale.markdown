I've finally decided to put up all of my photography equipment for sale. It's a hard decision given it's taken me a long time to acquire all this awesome hardware, but truth be told, I don't use it as much anymore. I used to spend a lot of my time shooting sports and it's served me very well. The kids are growing up now so I don't find myself reaching for it as often. I might as well let it go.

Absolutely everything is mint. Here it is, piece by piece.

### 1. [Nikon D200 Body w/ MB-D200: $400](http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/dslr-cameras/D200.html)

It's a great sports camera. It's comes with two batteries and the [MB-D200 Multi-Power Batter Pack](http://www.amazon.ca/Nikon-MB-D200-Multi-Power-Battery-Digital/dp/B000BY52O4), so you'll **never** run out of juice. I never have.

### 2. [Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S VR Zoom Nikkor: $1750](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-70-200mm-Nikkor-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00009MDBQ)

I don't really need to say much about this lens. If you're looking at this post you're most likely familiar with this lens. It's a **must have** lens for almost any professional or prosumer photographer. It comes with the HM-31 lens hood and a Nikon L37c UV Haze filter

### 3. [Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX: $850](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/300490-USA/Nikon_2147_17_55mm_f_2_8G_ED_IF_AF_S.html)
{% img left https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I1ExpP_sStU/VHjJnsxre7I/AAAAAAAAIS8/j_WpCIhKkpI/w1248-h829-no/DSCF0074.JPG %}

At $1400 retail, you can't beat this deal. [Ken Rockwell has some very good things to say](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/1755.htm) about this lens. It comes with a B+W F-Pro UV filter.

### 4. [Nikon AF-S VR Micro-Nikkor 105mm f/2.8G IF-ED: $700](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/424744-USA/Nikon_2160_105mm_f_2_8G_ED_IF_AF_S.html)
{% img left https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/M4Fz0cgZNHOQI1nCwNuUaU9_jkfrccv65j-IxnaHApM=w1248-h829-no %}

This is probably my favorite lens. It comes with a Rodenstock E62 UV filter.

### 5. [Nikon 10.5mm f/2.8G ED DX Fisheye Nikkor: $500](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/300487-USA/Nikon_2148_10_5mm_f_2_8G_ED_DX.html)
{% img left https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/OKDYcfJ3NQCUIEtJP2i5LFBVFJQXJ30aYNDYxg9OLw0=w1248-h829-no %}

This is a really fun lens with an ultra-wide picture angle of 180 degrees. The lens-hood is built-in.

### 6. [Nikon 50mm f/1.4D AF Nikkor: $200](http://www.adorama.com/NK5014AFDU.html)
{% img left https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hQNERgRxjAw/VHjJo2s7kzI/AAAAAAAAIWg/M1Zau7TV6qU/w1248-h829-no/DSCF0079.JPG %}

This is absolutely awesome in low light situations where flash is not an option. Great for indoor sports. It comes with a Rodenstock E52 UV filter.

### 6. [Nikon TC-17E II 1.7x Auto Focus Teleconverter: $400](http://www.adorama.com/NKTC17E2U.html)
{% img left https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kRE5Q4WysbQ/VHjJq1PTN3I/AAAAAAAAIVo/11WCFj22zDM/w1248-h829-no/DSCF0083.JPG %}

Allows you to increase the focal-length by 1.7x to any lenses. Great when you need a little extra for sports or wildlife.

### 7. [Nikon SB-800 AF Speedlight: $250](http://www.amazon.ca/Nikon-SB-800-Speedlight-Digital-Cameras/dp/B00015GYU4)
{% img left https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/goiWCNSLC7kRo3HwjCxTzEkRUBndedhbDqJ1tzn73eA=w1248-h829-no %}

A great flash that can be remote-controlled from the D200 body. You can place it anywhere.

### 8. [Rodenstock 77mm Circular Polarizer HR: $100](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/876234-REG/Rodenstock_407740_77mm_Circular_Polarizer_HR.html)
{% img left https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ifwjeQe06cjizLQ2r_Noxf79ulHcxfTmIqssH5fgCIU=w1248-h828-no %}

I have a step-up ring that will allow you to use this filter on the 50mm 1.4.

### 9. [Tamrac 5588 Expedition 8x Photo/Laptop Backpack: $250](http://www.amazon.ca/Tamrac-Expedition-Photo-Laptop-Backpack/dp/B00148XH5M)

It's the bag on the right, and it fits everything that you see on the table. It's perfect for the whole lot.

### 10. [Kata R-103 GDC Rucksack: $150](http://www.amazon.com/KATA-KT-R-103-Kata-Rucksack/dp/B0009PYV6K)
{% img left https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sGDb6yKv4EQ/VHjJnFtu5TI/AAAAAAAAITU/r-AnrIatC04/w1248-h829-no/DSCF0067.JPG %}

A smaller bag, but I usually carry this when I don't need to haul everything.

## Miscellaneous Items
* [Nikon MC-36: $80](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/892745-REG/Nikon_27032_MC_36_Multi_Function_Remote_Cord.html)
* [Nikon SC-29: $40](http://www.amazon.ca/NIKON-SC-29-Coiled-Remote-Cord/dp/B00019JPRO)

* Booth Reflector, Lens Brush, Lens Case, etc - Free

## Package Deal
I've tried to price everything quite aggressively. I tried to find all items on either Adorama or Amazon to get comparable prices for the items if you were to buy them new. When I add everything up you will find that my prices are 1/3 less. If you're interested in the whole lot, I'll add another 10%.
